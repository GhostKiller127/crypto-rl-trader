# AI Crypto Trading Algorithm
A reinforcement learning-based cryptocurrency trading algorithm implemented in JAX, capable of performing both long and short trades on Bybit futures.


## Overview
This project implements a distributed off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm with a meta learner, inspired by the [GDI paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03192). It utilizes the memory-efficient state space model [S5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04933) and operates on 15-minute intervals.


## Technical Implementation

### Current Architecture
- Distributed off-policy reinforcement learning
- Custom crypto trading environment (similar to OpenAI Gym)
- Memory-efficient state space model (S5)
- JAX implementation for efficient execution
- Supports both long and short positions on Bybit futures

### Development Roadmap
1. Price Prediction Enhancement
   - State-of-the-art time series forecasting
   - Multi-head prediction architecture
   - Uncertainty estimation

2. Advanced Search Strategies
   - Hybrid RL architecture
   - Model-based planning
   - Dynamic search optimization
